## What is Fuego ?

Fuego is a decentralized layer-1 privacy blockchain banking p2p network based on the CryptoNote protocol, that allows monetary value within the network to inherit sound money properties with modern private banking-grade benefits of secure savings storage, untraceable payments & transfers, zero knowledge-[collateralization](https://github.com/usexfg/cold-dao) with zkSTARKs, & access to private high-yield interest offerings; all by using XF₲.

Built by advocates for freedom thru sound money, Fuego functions as a free & open source alternative to the centralized banking model. Thru it's **decentralized** design, Fuego L1 network is owned by it's users; not by any singular entity nor evil corp_oration, and is freely available online 24/7/365 to anyone- worldwide, as a public tool for privacy & financial freedom.

Unique features of Fuego include untraceable p2p messaging (up to 300 characters per message) as well as, time-locked (3 month standard) on-chain deposits, also known as  [COLD](https://github.com/usexfg/cold-dao): an initiative to earn (defi) interest on $XFG **C**ertificate **O**f **L**edger **D**eposit yield. (alpha version available, with zk-deposit proofs and automated interest redemption expected in 2025.)

## What is XF₲ ?

**XF₲** (or ₲ /🔥) is a privacy cryptocurrency and the accounting units (heat) used within the Fuego L1 network blockchain ledger. XFG is minted into the Fuego network via block rewards and distributed to miners in exchange for computational processing power to secure the Fuego blockchain using ASIC-resistant proof of work consensus, approximately every 8 minutes. Each XFG is divisible up to 7 decimal places, and just like USD *cents* or BTC *sats*- XFG can be referenced down to singular atomic units called `heat` (0.0000001 = 1 heat)

All transactions in **XFG** are already private by default, much like cash & paper money is- but without *central banksters*. [insert brrr meme]

***Unlike*** traditional fiat currencies issued by central banking cartels of the world, **XF₲** is more accurately defined as a form of hard money for its fixed, yet dynamic money supply of 8 Million **XF₲**. And unlike even most PoW cryptocurrencies, Fuego is designed to **thrive** within a disinflationary ecosystem; incentived thru XFG transaction fees, C0DL3 gas fees, & lottery-style block fees from certificates of deposit transactions: [COLD](https://github.com/usexfg/cold-dao) fees being a % rate of each XFG deposit amount (determined, along with interest rates, by [DAO](https://github.com/usexfg/cold-dao)- and) paid to miners. 


Fuego's **Ξlderfire Privacy Council** is a group of active & incredibly badass Fuego users and Eldernode* operators contributing to the furtherment of Fuego’s open-source network code development, and/or glorious ecosystem expansion of **XF₲** (merchants, services, tools, etc)

<sup>(*) Eldernodes are service nodes which earn a percentage for each txn they relay on Fuego network. For more info and a list of tutorials, see & contribute to our [Guides](https://github.com/usexfg/Guides/wiki/) section.

<sup> Fuego exists only because of open-source contributions and regular people like you & I running free (as in freedom) software on our machines. Whether it be an act of altruism, rebellion, or an act of freedom- our **action** is what matters. We **are** able to break free from tyranny simply by choosing to use & accept decentralized (privacy) cryptocurrencies for our payments and purchases. *In hoc signo vinces*</sup></sup>
