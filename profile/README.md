## What is Fuego ?

Fuego is a layer-1 decentralized privacy blockchain banking p2p network based on the CryptoNote protocol, that enables value within the network to inherit sound money properties, and benefits of modern privacy banking like secure storage of savings, unstoppable peer-to-peer payments & transfers, zero-knowledge [collateralization](https://github.com/usexfg/cold-dao) with zkSTARKs, & access to high-tier interest offers on XFG deposit yield.  Built by advocates for freedom thru sound money, Fuego functions as a free & open source alternative to the centralized banking model. Thru it's **decentralized** design, the Fuego L1 network is owned by no 'one' person- no singular entity, no corrupt government, nor evil corp_oration- but by all it's users thru distributed consensus. Fuego is freely available online 24/7/365 to anyone- worldwide, as a public tool for privacy & financial freedom.

Unique features of Fuego include ultra-secure p2p wallet messaging, as well as time-locked (3 month standard) on-chain deposits, also known as  [COLD](https://github.com/usexfg/cold-dao): an initiative to earn (defi) interest on $XFG **C**ertificate **O**f **L**edger **D**eposit yield. (alpha version available, with zk-deposit proofs and automated interest redemption expected in 2025.)

## What is XF₲ ?

**XFG** (or ₲ /🔥) is a privacy cryptocurrency and accounting units (ħeat) used within Fuego network's blockchain ledger. XFG is minted into existance by block rewards and distributed to miners in exchange for computational processing power to secure the Fuego blockchain using ASIC-resistant proof of work consensus, approximately every 8 minutes. Each XFG is divisible up to 7 decimal places, and just like USD *cents* or BTC *sats*- XFG can be referenced down to singular atomic units called `ħeat`

<h2><sup>(₲0.0000001 = 1 ħeat)</sup></h2>

Any transactions made in **XFG** are private by default, much like cash money is- but without the corruption of *central banksters*. [insert brrr meme]

***Unlike*** traditional fiat currencies issued by central banking cartels of our world, **XF₲** is more accurately defined as a form of hard money for its fixed, yet dynamic money supply of 8 Million **XF₲**. And unlike most PoW cryptocurrencies today, Fuego is designed to **thrive** within a disinflationary ecosystem; incentived thru XFG transaction fees, C0DL3 gas fees, & lottery-style block fees from certificates of deposit transactions: [COLD](https://github.com/usexfg/cold-dao) fees being a % rate of each XFG deposit amount (determined, along with interest rates, by [DAO](https://github.com/usexfg/cold-dao)- and) paid to miners. 


The Fuego **Ælder King's Council** is one group of active & incredibly badass Fuego Ξlderfier* operators contributing to the development of USEXFG's open-source code repositories, and/or expansion of the **XF₲** ecosystem (merchants, services, tools, etc) Requirements for becoming an Ælder King include a valid stake of 8000 XFG.

<sup>(*) Ξlderfiers are service nodes which earn a percentage for each txn they relay on Fuego network. Currently Eldernodes handle this, eventually Ξlderfiers will be staked nodes providing relay operations for trusted communication to/from Fuego's zkC0DL3 rollup, and connection to the greater crypto/web3 ecosystem. For more info and a list of tutorials, see & contribute to our [Guides](https://github.com/usexfg/Guides/wiki/) section.

<sup> Fuego exists only because of open-source contributions and regular people like you & I running free (as in freedom) software on our machines. Whether it be an act of altruism, rebellion, or an act of freedom- our **action** is what matters. One **could** even escape the clutches of tyranny (were conditions as such) by choosing the routine action of simply accepting payment in decentralized privacy currencies for PEER-based transactions already happening throughout our normal human interactions in everyday life. *In hoc signo vinces*</sup></sup>
