## What is Fuego ?

Fuego is a decentralized peer-to-peer privacy banking network based on the CryptoNote protocol, which enables users to securely store, transfer, & [collateralize](https://github.com/usexfg/cold-dao) monetary value- privately, using XFG.
Built by advocates of freedom thru sound money, Fuego functions as a free & open source alternative to the old centralized banking model. Thru it's **decentralized** design, Fuego network is owned by it's users; not by any singular entity nor evil corp_oration, and is available free to everyone as a public utility for privacy & financial freedom.

Unique features of Fuego network include untraceable p2p messaging (up to 300 characters per message) as well as, time-locked (3 month standard) on-chain deposits, also known as  [COLD](https://github.com/usexfg/cold-dao): an initiative to earn (defi) interest on $XFG **C**ertificate **O**f **L**edger **D**eposit yield. (alpha version available, with zk-deposit proofs and automated interest redemption expected in 2024.)

## What is XF‚Ç≤ ?

**XF‚Ç≤** (or *Fire/ Fuego*) is a privacy cryptocurrency and accounting unit(s) used within the blockchain ledger of the Fuego network. XFG is minted into the network by block reward and is distributed to miners in exchange for using their electrical power to secure the Fuego network's blockchain thru Proof of Work (CPU/GPU) consensus, approximately every 8 minutes.

All transactions in **XFG** are already private by default, much like cash or paper money is- but without the *central banksters*.

***Unlike*** traditional fiat currencies issued by central banking cartels of the world, **XF‚Ç≤** can more accurately be defined as a form of hard money for its fixed, limited supply of 8 Million **XF‚Ç≤**. And unlike most PoW cryptocurrencies, Fuego is designed to functionally thrive within a disinflationary ecosystem; incentived thru transaction fee markets & lottery-style block fees from deposits : [COLD](https://github.com/usexfg/cold-dao) fees being a % rate of each XFG deposit amount (determined, along with interest rates, by [DAO](https://github.com/usexfg/cold-dao)- and) paid to miners. 


Fuego's **Elder Council** is a group of active Fuego users and Elder Node* operators contributing to the furtherment of Fuego‚Äôs open-source network code development, and/or glorious expansion of the **XFG** ecosystem (merchants, services, tools, etc)

<sup>(*) Elder Nodes are service nodes which earn a percentage for each txn they relay on the Fuego network. For more info and a list of tutorials, see & contribute to our [Guides](https://github.com/usexfg/Guides/wiki/) section.

<sup> Fuego exists only because of open-source contributions and regular people like you & I running free (as in freedom) software on our machines. Whether it be an act of altruism, act of rebellion, or an act of freedom- our **action** is what matters. We're able to break free from tyranny simply by choosing to accept decentralized (privacy) cryptocurrencies for our payments and purchases. *In hoc signo vinces*</sup></sup>
