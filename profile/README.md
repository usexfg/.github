## What is Fuego ?

Fuego is a decentralized p2p privacy blockchain banking network based on the CryptoNote protocol, that enables value within its network to inherit sound money properties and the benefits of modern private banking like secure storage of value, untraceable peer-to-peer payments & transfers, zero-knowledge [collateralization](https://github.com/usexfg/cold-dao) with zkSTARKs, & access to high-tier defi interest on XFG deposit yield.

Developed by advocates for freedom thru sound money, Fuego functions as a free & fully open-source blockchain bank to provide an alternative to ~tyranny~ centralized banking. Thru it's **decentralized** design, the Fuego p2p network is owned not by any 'one' person- nor singular entity, corrupt governments, or evil corp_orations- instead, Fuego is owned by it's users thru distributed consensus. Available online 24/7/365 free to anyone- worldwide, as a public tool for digital privacy, economic sovereignty, and financial freedom.

Unique features of Fuego include ultra-secure p2p wallet messaging, as well as time-locked (3 months or 1 year terms) on-chain deposits, also known as [COLD](https://github.com/usexfg/cold-dao): an initiative to earn (defi) interest on $XFG **C**ertificate **O**f **L**edger **D**eposit yield. (alpha version available, with zk-proofs and smart contract interest redemption expected early 2026. update: 2/26 live on TESTNET)

## What is XF₲ ?

**XFG** (or ₲ /🔥) is a private cryptocurrency and accounting unit (ħeat) used within Fuego network's blockchain ledger. XFG is minted into existance by block rewards and distributed to miners in exchange for computational processing power to secure the Fuego blockchain using ASIC-resistant proof of work consensus, approximately every 8 minutes. Each XFG is divisible up to 7 decimal places, and just like USD *cents* or BTC *sats*- each XFG can be referenced down to singular (atomic) units called `ħeat`

<h2><sup>(₲0.0000001 = 1 ħeat)</sup></h2>

Any transaction made in **XFG** is private by default, much like cash money is- but without the corruption of *central banksters*. [insert brrr meme]

***Unlike*** traditional fiat currencies issued by central banking cartels of our world, **XF₲** is more accurately defined as a form of hard money for its fixed, yet dynamic money supply of 8 Million **XF₲**. And unlike most PoW cryptocurrencies of today, Fuego is designed to **thrive** within a disinflationary ecosystem; incentived thru XFG transaction fees, C0DL3 gas fees, & lottery-style block fees from certificates of deposit transactions: [COLD](https://github.com/usexfg/cold-dao) fees being a % rate of each XFG deposit amount (interest rates are determined by [DAO](https://github.com/usexfg/cold-dao)) all paid to miners. Eventually, the Ælder Kings Council (see below) will handle the Fuego side of voting decisions on deposit fees & burn fees.


The Fuego **Ælder Kings Council** is one group of active & incredibly badass Fuego Ξlderfier* operators contributing to the further development and expansion of USEXFG's open-source code repositories and as a result, the **XF₲** ecosystem (merchants, services, tools, etc) by running stable service nodes which periodically attest to the veracity of Fuego blockchain merkle roots, which enables trustless cross-chain communication with Fuego's modular privacy L3 rollup (`zkC0DL3`) as well as, other platforms &/or broader crypto ecosystem.  As a result, all Fuego banking fees (0.1% of each burn or cold amount) are exclusively reserved for, and equally distributed (with privacy) to, participating Ξlderfiers. <sub><sup>Requires a valid stake of **4000** XFG for on-chain Ξlderfier registration.</sup></sub>

<sup>(*) Eldernodes are basic service nodes which earn a percentage for each txn they relay on Fuego network. Eventually ***Ξlderfiers*** (staked nodes) will also provide these relay operations, in addition to verifying merkle roots for cross-chain communication. For more info and a list of tutorials, see & contribute to our [Guides](https://github.com/usexfg/Guides/wiki/) section.

<sup> Fuego exists only because of open-source contributions and regular people like you & I running free (as in freedom) software on our machines. Whether it be an act of altruism, rebellion, or an act of freedom- our **action** is what matters. One **could** even escape the clutches of tyranny (were conditions as such) by choosing the routine action of simply accepting payment in decentralized privacy currencies for PEER-based transactions already happening throughout our normal human interactions in everyday life. *In hoc signo vinces*</sup></sup>
