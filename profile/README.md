## What is Fuego ($XFG) ?

Fuego is a decentralized peer-to-peer privacy blockchain network based on the CryptoNote protocol which can be used to securely store, transfer, & [grow](https://github.com/usexfg/cold-dao) monetary value- privately.
Built by advocates for freedom thru sound money, Fuego functions as a free & open source alternative to the old centralized banking model. Thru it's decentralized design, the Fuego network is owned by no one and itâ€™s public utility available to everyone.

<b>$XFG</b> is the currency of the Fuego network, distributed by block rewards to miners securing the network thru Proof of Work consensus every 8 minutes. 
Fuego ($XFG) is sound money with a fixed limited supply of 8 Million 8. (8M8)

Special features of Fuego network include untraceable peer-to-peer messages (up to 300 characters per message) as well as on-chain deposits- also known as  [COLD](https://github.com/usexfg/cold-dao): an initiative to earn defi interest on $XFG **C**ertificate **O**f **L**edger **D**eposit yield. (working prototype available since late 2022, with full version expected as soon as 2023.)

Fuego's Elder Node Council is a group of any Fuego users or Elder Node operators contributing towards the open-source development of Fuegoâ€™s network codebase, expansion of the Fuego ecosystem (merchants, services, etc) and/or general perpetuation of the $XFG currency. 
Elder Nodes (service nodes) also earn a percentage of $XFG for each txn they process on the Fuego network. For more info on Elder Nodes and more tutorials see  [Guides](https://github.com/usexfg/Guides/wiki/Run-an-Elder-Node) section.
