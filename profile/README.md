## What is Fuego ?

Fuego is a decentralized privacy banking network based on the CryptoNote protocol that enables users to securely store, transfer, & [collateralize](https://github.com/usexfg/cold-dao) monetary value- privately, using XFG.

Built by advocates for freedom thru sound money, Fuego functions as a free & open source alternative to the old centralized banking model. Thru it's **decentralized** design, Fuego network is owned by it's users; not by any singular entity nor evil corp_oration, and is available online 24/7/365 to everyone of any race, gender, age, creed, or country of origin- free as a public tool for privacy & financial freedom.

Unique features of Fuego network include untraceable p2p messaging (up to 300 characters per message) as well as, time-locked (3 month standard) on-chain deposits, also known as  [COLD](https://github.com/usexfg/cold-dao): an initiative to earn (defi) interest on $XFG **C**ertificate **O**f **L**edger **D**eposit yield. (alpha version available, with zk-deposit proofs and automated interest redemption expected in 2025.)

## What is XF₲ ?

**XF₲** (or *Fire* / *Fuego* / ₲ /🔥) is a privacy cryptocurrency and accounting units used within the blockchain ledger of the Fuego network. XFG is minted into the network thru block rewards and distributes to miners in exchange for their computational processing power, which secures the Fuego network blockchain using an ASIC-resistant proof of work consensus, approximately every 8 minutes.

All transactions in **XFG** are already private by default, much like cash or paper money is- but without the *central banksters*.

***Unlike*** traditional fiat currencies issued by central banking cartels of the world, **XF₲** can more accurately be defined as a form of hard money for its fixed, limited supply of 8 Million **XF₲**. And unlike even most PoW cryptocurrencies, Fuego is designed to **thrive** within a disinflationary ecosystem; incentived thru transaction fee markets & lottery-style block fees from deposits : [COLD](https://github.com/usexfg/cold-dao) fees being a % rate of each XFG deposit amount (determined, along with interest rates, by [DAO](https://github.com/usexfg/cold-dao)- and) paid to miners. 


Fuego's **Elder Council** is a group of active Fuego users and Elder Node* operators contributing to the furtherment of Fuego’s open-source network code development, and/or glorious expansion of the **XFG** ecosystem (merchants, services, tools, etc)

<sup>(*) Elder Nodes are service nodes which earn a percentage for each txn they relay on the Fuego network. For more info and a list of tutorials, see & contribute to our [Guides](https://github.com/usexfg/Guides/wiki/) section.

<sup> Fuego exists only because of open-source contributions and regular people like you & I running free (as in freedom) software on our machines. Whether it be an act of altruism, rebellion, or an act of freedom- our **action** is what matters. We **are** able to break free from tyranny by choosing to use & accept decentralized (privacy) cryptocurrencies for our payments and purchases. *In hoc signo vinces*</sup></sup>
