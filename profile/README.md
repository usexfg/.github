## What is Fuego ?

Fuego is a decentralized peer-to-peer privacy blockchain network based on the CryptoNote protocol which allows users to securely store, transfer, & [collateralize](https://github.com/usexfg/cold-dao)* monetary value- privately.
Built by advocates of freedom thru sound money, Fuego functions as a free & open source alternative to the old centralized banking model. Thru it's decentralized design, Fuego network is owned by no individual or corporation and it’s public utility is freely available to everyone.
Unique features of Fuego network include untraceable peer-to-peer messaging  (up to 300 characters per message) as well as time-locked (3 month standard) on-chain deposits- also known as  [COLD](https://github.com/usexfg/cold-dao): an initiative to earn (defi) interest on $XFG **C**ertificate **O**f **L**edger **D**eposit yield. (alpha version available since late 2022, with zero-knowledge proof of deposit and automated smart contract redemption expected as soon as 2023.)

## What is XF₲ ?

**XF₲** (or *Fuego*) is the currency and accounting unit used by the Fuego network. XFG is distributed into the network by block rewards, minted by miners in exchange for powering and securing the blockchain thru Proof of Work (mobile/IoT CPU, GPU) consensus approximately every 8 minutes.  Unlike traditional fiat currencies issued by central banking cartels of the world, Fuego (XFG) can actually be defined as a form of hard money- for its fixed, limited supply of 8 Million 8 **XF₲** (8M8) and is designed to functionally thrive within a disinflationary ecosystem. (incentived thru transaction fees & [COLD](https://github.com/usexfg/cold-dao) fees, based on interest rates)


Fuego's Elder Council is a group consisting of Fuego users and Elder Node* operators who are contributing toward the further development of Fuego’s open-source network code, the continuous expansion of the Fuego ecosystem, (merchants, services, etc) and/or general perpetuation of the $XFG currency. 

<sup>(*) Elder Nodes are service nodes which earn a percentage for each txn they relay on the Fuego network. For more info and a list of tutorials see our [Guides](https://github.com/usexfg/Guides/wiki/) section and feel free to contribute. Fuego only exists because of open-source contributions and regular people like you & I, running free (as in freedom) software on our machine. Whether it be from an act of rebellion, act of altruism, or an act of freedom- the **action** is what matters. We break free from tyranny just by using & accepting decentralized (privacy) cryptocurrencies for our payments and purchases!<sup>
