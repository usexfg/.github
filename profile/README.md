## What is Fuego (XFG) ?

Fuego is a decentralized peer-to-peer privacy blockchain network based on the CryptoNote protocol which can be used to securely store, [grow](https://github.com/usexfg/cold-dao), & transfer monetary value- privately.
Built by sound money advocates and freedom fighters, Fuego functions as a free & open source alternative to the old centralized banking model. Thru it's decentralized design, the Fuego network is owned by no one and itâ€™s public utility available to everyone.

<b>XFG</b> is the currency of the Fuego network, distributed by block rewards to miners securing the network thru Proof of Work consensus every 8 minutes. 
Fuego XFG is sound money with a fixed limited supply of 8 Million 8. (8M8)

Fuego's Elder Node Council is a group of any Fuego users or Elder Node operators collaborating to contribute towards the open-source development of Fuegoâ€™s network codebase, expanding the Fuego ecosystem (merchants, services, etc) and/or general perpetuation of the XFG currency. 
Elder Nodes (service nodes) also earn a percentage of each txn they process on the Fuego network. For more info on Elder Nodes see our [Guides](https://github.com/usexfg/guides) section.
