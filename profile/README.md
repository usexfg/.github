## What is Fuego ?

Fuego is a decentralized peer-to-peer privacy banking network based on the CryptoNote protocol, which enables users to securely store, transfer, & even [collateralize](https://github.com/usexfg/cold-dao) monetary value- privately, by using XFG.
Built by advocates of freedom thru sound money, Fuego functions as a free & open source alternative to the old centralized banking model. Thru it's **decentralized** design, Fuego network is owned by it's users; not by any singular individual or evil corp_oration- and is available free to everyone as a public utility.

Unique features of Fuego network include untraceable peer-to-peer messaging capabilities (up to 300 characters per message) as well as time-locked (3 month standard) on-chain deposits- also known as  [COLD](https://github.com/usexfg/cold-dao): an initiative to earn (defi) interest on $XFG **C**ertificate **O**f **L**edger **D**eposit yield. (alpha version available since late 2022, with zero-knowledge proof of deposit and automated smart contract redemption expected in 2024.)

## What is XF‚Ç≤ ?

**XF‚Ç≤** (or *Fuego/ Fire*) is a privacy cryptocurrency and the accounting unit(s) used within the Fuego network. XFG is minted into the network by block rewards, distributed to miners in exchange for powering and securing the Fuego blockchain thru Proof of Work (CPU/GPU) consensus, approximately every 8 minutes. 

All transactions in **XFG** are already  private by default, much like cash or paper money is- only better.

*Unlike* traditional fiat currencies issued by central banking cartels of the world, **XF‚Ç≤** can more accurately be defined as a form of hard money for its fixed, limited supply of 8 Million **XF‚Ç≤**. And unlike most PoW cryptocurrencies, Fuego is designed to functionally thrive within a disinflationary ecosystem; incentived thru transaction fee markets & lottery deposit block fees: [COLD](https://github.com/usexfg/cold-dao) fees being a % rate of each XFG deposit amount (determined, along with interest rates, by [DAO](https://github.com/usexfg/cold-dao)- and) paid to miners. 



Fuego's **Elder Council** is the group of active Fuego Elder Node* operators contributing to the furtherment of Fuego‚Äôs open-source network code development, and/or glorious expansion of the **XFG** ecosystem (merchants, services, tools, etc)

<sup>(*) Elder Nodes are service nodes which earn a percentage for each txn they relay on the Fuego network. For more info and a list of tutorials see or contribute to our [Guides](https://github.com/usexfg/Guides/wiki/) section !

<sup> Fuego exists only because of open-source contributions and regular people like you & I running free (as in freedom) software on our machines. Whether it be an act of rebellion, act of altruism, or an act of freedom- our **action** is what matters. We are able to break free from tyranny simply by choosing to accept decentralized privacy cryptocurrencies for our payments and purchases. *In hoc signo vinces*</sup></sup>
