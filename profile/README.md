## What is Fuego ?

Fuego is a decentralized p2p privacy blockchain banking network based on the CryptoNote protocol, that enables value within its network to inherit sound money properties, benefits of modern privacy banking like secure storage of value, unstoppable peer-to-peer payments & transfers, zero-knowledge [collateralization](https://github.com/usexfg/cold-dao) with zkSTARKs, & access to high-tier interest offers on XFG deposit yield.

Built by advocates for freedom thru sound money, Fuego functions as a free & open source alternative to centralized banking. Thru it's **decentralized** design, the Fuego p2p network is owned not by any 'one' person- nor singular entity, corrupt government, or evil corp_oration- instead Fuego is owned by it's users thru distributed consensus. Fuego is freely available online 24/7/365 to anyone- worldwide, as a public tool for privacy & financial freedom.

Unique features of Fuego include ultra-secure p2p wallet messaging, as well as time-locked (3 months or 1 year terms) on-chain deposits, also known as  [COLD](https://github.com/usexfg/cold-dao): an initiative to earn (defi) interest on $XFG **C**ertificate **O**f **L**edger **D**eposit yield. (alpha version available, with zk-deposit proofs and smart contract interest redemption expected early 2026.)

## What is XF₲ ?

**XFG** (or ₲ /🔥) is a private cryptocurrency and accounting unit (ħeat) used within Fuego network's blockchain ledger. XFG is minted into existance by block rewards and distributed to miners in exchange for computational processing power to secure the Fuego blockchain using ASIC-resistant proof of work consensus, approximately every 8 minutes. Each XFG is divisible up to 7 decimal places, and just like USD *cents* or BTC *sats*- XFG can be referenced down to singular (atomic) units called `ħeat`

<h2><sup>(₲0.0000001 = 1 ħeat)</sup></h2>

Any transaction made in **XFG** is private by default, much like cash money is- but without the corruption of *central banksters*. [insert brrr meme]

***Unlike*** traditional fiat currencies issued by central banking cartels of our world, **XF₲** is more accurately defined as a form of hard money for its fixed, yet dynamic money supply of 8 Million **XF₲**. And unlike most PoW cryptocurrencies of today, Fuego is designed to **thrive** within a disinflationary ecosystem; incentived thru XFG transaction fees, C0DL3 gas fees, & lottery-style block fees from certificates of deposit transactions: [COLD](https://github.com/usexfg/cold-dao) fees being a % rate of each XFG deposit amount (interest rates are determined by [DAO](https://github.com/usexfg/cold-dao)) all paid to miners. Eventually, the Ælder Kings Council (see below) will handle the Fuego side of voting decisions on deposit fees & burn fees.


The Fuego **Ælder Kings Council** is one group of active & incredibly badass Fuego Ξlderfier* operators contributing to the development of USEXFG's open-source code repositories, and/or expansion of the **XF₲** ecosystem (merchants, services, tools, etc) Requirements include a valid stake of **1600** XFG.

<sup>(*) Ξlderfiers are service nodes which earn a percentage for each txn they relay on Fuego network. Currently handled by Eldernodes, eventually ***Ξlderfiers*** (staked nodes) will be providing relay operations for trusted communication to/from Fuego's modular privacy L3 rollup (`zkC0DL3`), and connection to the greater crypto/web3 ecosystem. For more info and a list of tutorials, see & contribute to our [Guides](https://github.com/usexfg/Guides/wiki/) section.

<sup> Fuego exists only because of open-source contributions and regular people like you & I running free (as in freedom) software on our machines. Whether it be an act of altruism, rebellion, or an act of freedom- our **action** is what matters. One **could** even escape the clutches of tyranny (were conditions as such) by choosing the routine action of simply accepting payment in decentralized privacy currencies for PEER-based transactions already happening throughout our normal human interactions in everyday life. *In hoc signo vinces*</sup></sup>
